ApolloGeese Web Server
======================

Goodday blagizen, I have lured you into my repository of apologetic greatness and I am afraid you find yourself now enticed to read on. So import some German Fanta and grab onto a bag of peanuts for dear life.

Philosophy
----------

The ridiculous majority of Web Services seem to be built by means of a not very structural, very sequential, weakly typed, never-ending concatenation of characters, line-breaks and other advocates of nightmare and dismay. I'm looking at you here, PHP, Python, ASP(.Net) and those who shall not be mentioned.

This notion of incomprehensible, scripted linearity makes me as a developer awfully unhappy for precisely twenty-eight reasons:
* Interaction is defined as if the customer were a resource being passed on by conveyors in a factory.
* Superiors don't know what you're up to until it's too late.
* It's not fun to make or understand, unless you're slightly mad. 

Using those twenty-eight reasons which are actually three reasons (but youknow, I have to prepare for the future) I will spoon-feed, slip-and-slide, drag-and-drop, butt-and-lube you into the idea behind ApolloGeese.

### The Customer Conveyor

As I mentioned earlier, the web has been mostly, if not entirely, programmed in languages that process the customer's request using a list of instructions. The very mentality that our visitor is just a resource for our factory (the webservice), in making the product (the website) is wrong. This claim is laid, for this linearity transitions into the way we present ourselves to the world. If we fail to let go of the habbit of linearizing our on-line communications, websites will never be more than the metaphorical tinny-voiced robots telling us the way to go, but not precisely the way we wanted to know.

In real life, our guided tours don't consist of simply showing the facade of our buildings. And yet we do this online and we even have the audacity of pretending it's representing who we are and what we do. Our websites are just tall piles of ever-shrinking blocks of textual bricks and stock-photography windows in an otherwise well-designed frame.

No, in real life, we'd love to take everyone who is interrested into our environments. We show them through all the corridors, cubicles, halls and rooms. We show it precisely so that we spark the customer's curiousity, evoke questions and provide satisfactory answers to these questions using the very structure of our environment as a boilerplate to achieve this.

That brings us to the first aim of ApolloGeese: Structure. If someone who is interrested in what you've to offer, immediately observes a simple structure in the way you present yourself, they know what to ask, and where to look. Your presentation will prove useful.

We need to achieve this by punishing the developer immediately when they implement an incoherent structure. Not explicitly, but by design. ApolloGeese is made so when the developer has to double-take what they just made, it's too complex for the customer too, and needs to be revised.

### Aye, Captain

"The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it's too late." -Seymour Cray

Nothing makes an employer quite as itchy as not knowing precisely what their developer is up to. I'm not particularly fond of the notion of employers - though admittedly some are quite bearable - but I'm especially not fond of employers with an itch. They scratch for your precise motives and activities, often times making you nervous and hampering your productivity, instead of boosting it.

Meanwhile, it seems to be a long upheld lie by the programmer's guild that programming involves pages and pages of source code which is meaningless to the uneducated reader. UML - though in concept pretty cool - seems to have been developed to further support this. It allows for a visual representation of the product and it isn't any more comprehensible than the original product.

The combination of employer curiousity and employee closedness is a source of needless friction.

To remove this friction, meaningfull and useful documentation needs to be produced. Not explicitly, but by design. Elements in the developers design irrevokably display their purpose and their coherence with the rest of the design. If the element's purpose is unclear, it's unclear for both the designer and the executive, and is therefore useless.

### You're a madman

It is countless times I have found myself getting familiar with a bunch of website source code written by someone who has
a. Disappointed their mother
b. Probably died

Generally, this source code runs into thousands of lines and seems meaningless at first sight, because the concept 'identifier' didn't entirely trickle down in the developer's mind, now causing a bunch of either temporary or EXTREMELY RELEVANT variables to identify with the brief yet not very concise identifier 'BN'.

One may conclude from this not all developers are very crafty with identifiers.

So you've guessed it, there will be identifiers which are meaningful and useful at all times. Not explicitly, but by design! HA! Wrong. Identifiers are arseholes and an ApolloGeese webdesigner will have nothing to do with them when setting up the website.
