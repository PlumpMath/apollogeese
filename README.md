The ApolloGeese rant, v2.
-------------------------

Everything is marvellous, life's a sweet treat and unicorns dash around in celebration because I finally don't have to use [redacting] PHP or Python anymore for personal website projects.

I absolutely loathe programming with conditionals. Especially in back-end development which involves databases and already complicated front-ends.

Conditionals will take your questionable program flow and [redact] all over it to make your job even more obscure and tedious than it already is.

So I set out to make something which complies with the following requirements:
* It must be self-documenting
* It must be scalable as [redact]
* I can piece together any website with it
* I do not want to write a single IF-statement while doing so
